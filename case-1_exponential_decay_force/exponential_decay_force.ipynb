We need to characterize the motion of a falling object. The most fundamental description of motion is position as a function of time. Once we have a reliable set of data for the position, $y(t)$, of a falling object, we can apply the principles of calculus to determine its velocity, $v(t) = \\frac{dy}{dt}$, and its acceleration, $a(t) = \\frac{d^2y}{dt^2}$. The acceleration is of primary interest, as it is the quantity that directly reflects the influence of the gravitational force.\n",

A more careful analysis shows that the acceleration of the falling object *increases* as it gets closer to the ground, which is perfectly consistent with a law of the form `a = g(h)` where the gravitational pull is stronger at lower altitudes.\n",
