An object exists in a specific gravitational state `n` until its mass is sufficient for its \"gravitational potential\" (`sqrt(m)`) to cross the next integer threshold, at which point it instantaneously \"jumps\" to the next higher quantum state (`n+1`), experiencing a discretely stronger force. This explains why objects of `m=4.0` kg and `m=4.1` kg fall so differently: the former is in the `n=2` state, while the latter has just enough mass to enter the `n=3` state, dramatically increasing its interaction with the gravitational field.\n",
